            <h2>Description</h2>
            My favorite lunch is grilled cheese with a twist: strawberry jam. It is a delightful fusion of sweet and savory flavors that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite. The classic grilled cheese, oozing with melted cheese between slices of golden-brown bread, forms a warm base. Adding a generous smear of strawberry jam introduces a burst of fruity sweetness, creating a harmonious balance of flavors.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 slices of bread</li>
                <li>1 slice of colby jack cheese</li>
                <li>2 slices of muenster cheese</li>
                <li>Strawberry jam (or jelly)</li>
                <li>Butter (or mayo)</li>
                <li>Garlic powder</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat pan on low heat.</li>
                    <ul><i>Yes, the sandwich will take longer to cook, but sacrificing time will prevent a burnt sandwich!</i></ul>
                <li>Butter one side of both slices of bread. I like Texas Toast but any bread will do!</li>
                    <ul><i>Mayo will result in a crispier sandwich</i></ul>
                <li>On one slice, layer cheese in this order: muenster, colby, muenster. Place in heated pan.</li>
                <li>On the other slice of bread, spread strawberry jam on the unbuttered side. 
                <li>Place bread (strawberry side down) on top of melted cheese.</li>
                <li>Cook both sides until golden-brown.</li>
                <li>Remove from pan and slice to watch the cheese ooze out!</li>
            </ol>
