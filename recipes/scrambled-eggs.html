            <p>One of my favorite things to eat in the morning is scrambled eggs with hotdogs. It is a hearty and satisfying dish that's dirt cheap! Each bite offers a delightful contrast of textures and flavors, with the tender eggs complementing the slightly smoky and salty notes of the dogs.</p>
        
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 Eggs</li>
                <li>2 Hotdogs</li>
                <li>Milk or cream</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Garlic powder</li>
                <li>Paprika</li>
                <li>Salt</li>

            </ul>

                <li>Heat another pan over medium-low heat. Pan will be hot enough when a droplet of water can sizzle.</li>

                <li>Pour whisked eggs and fried hotdogs until it covers the entire pan.</li>
                <li>Let the eggs set for about 30 seconds before scrambling.</li>

                <li>Remove pan from heating element when eggs still look slightly wet (they will continue to cook).</li>
