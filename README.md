# odin-recipes

Completing my first "official" project for The Odin Project - Foundations!

April 21 11:47AM:
I have just submitted my first project and it was a lot of fun!

I practiced linking images and relative paths to other pages in my existing Odin Recipe webpage.
I will admit that I used ChatGPT on the descpritions, but the actual recipes themselves are ones I actually make daily.

Overall, very fun project!
